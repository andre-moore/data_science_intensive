# Springboard Data Science Intensive

The data being archived in this github repository represents projects that were completed during several months of assignments in the Springboard Data Science Intensive Program.

## Project 1 - Using Python Pandas to work with JSON and XML files 

1. Working with JSON (See sliderule_dsi_json_exercise.ipynb)

Using data in file 'data/world_bank_projects.json' and the techniques demonstrated above,

    Find the 10 countries with most projects
    Find the top 10 major project themes (using column 'mjtheme_namecode')
    In 2. above you will notice that some entries have only the code and the name is missing. Create a dataframe with the missing names filled in.

    

2. Working with XML (See sliderule_dsi_xml_exercise.ipynb)

Using data in 'data/mondial_database.xml', the examples above, and refering to https://docs.python.org/2.7/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html, find

    10 countries with the lowest infant mortality rates
    10 cities with the largest population
    10 ethnic groups with the largest overall populations (sum of best/latest estimates over all countries)
    name and country of a) longest river, b) largest lake and c) airport at highest elevation

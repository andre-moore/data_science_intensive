    "\n",
    "Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>Data</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the dataset provided, each row represents a resume. The 'race' column has two values, 'b' and 'w', indicating black-sounding and white-sounding. The column 'call' has two values, 1 and 0, indicating whether the resume received a call from employers or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the 'b' and 'w' values in race are assigned randomly to the resumes when presented to the employer."

    "<h2> Hypothesis Testing Approach</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to testing this problem consists of four steps: \n",
    " (1) State the hypotheses, \n",
    " (2) Formulate an analysis \n",
    " - Test Method. Use the two proportion z-test to determine if the hypothesized difference between population\n",
    "   proportions differs significantly from the observed sample difference. \n",
    "   differs significantly from the observed\n",
    " (3) Analyze sample data\n",
    " \n",
    "    - **Pooled sample proportion** Since the null hypothesis states that P1=P2, we use a pooled sample proportion (p) \n",
    "      to compute the standard error of the sampling distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "      p = (p1 * n1 + p2 * n2) / (n1 + n2)\n",
    "\n",
    "      where p1 is the sample proportion from population 1, p2 is the sample proportion from population 2, n1 is the size \n",
    "      of sample 1, and n2 is the size of sample 2.\n",
    "      <br>  <br>  \n",
    "    - **Standard error** Compute the standard error (SE) of the sampling distribution difference between two proportions.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      SE = sqrt{ p * ( 1 - p ) * [ (1/n1) + (1/n2) ] }\n",
    "\n",
    "      where p is the pooled sample proportion, n1 is the size of sample 1, and n2 is the size of sample 2.\n",
    "      <br>  <br>  \n",
    "    - **Test statistic** The test statistic is a z-score (z) defined by the following equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "      z = (p1 - p2) / SE\n",
    "\n",

    "      sampling distribution.\n",
    "      <br>  <br>\n",
    "      \n",
    "    - **P-value** The P-value is the probability of observing a sample statistic as extreme as the test statistic. Since the\n",
